# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I prefer it voer java because it seems to shorten the more complicated parts that Java has and replaces it with simpler yet similar functions. Python can still have lines of code that I don't 100% understand

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Statements such as else and and else if which is shortened to elif or functions that define processes such as in java.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I started to get the jist of the similariteis that I have seen before and can apply wit my past knowledge of coding such as else statements and functions.
